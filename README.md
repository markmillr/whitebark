Created: 02 January 2018

This repository contains source code for the whitebark planetary climate model and accompanies the book Modeling Planetary Climates with Python.

Currently, soilheat.py is the working copy of the model, and does not reference any other files, including the planets.py database (TODO). All other modules are in sandbox phase.
